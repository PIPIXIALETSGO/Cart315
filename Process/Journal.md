# In-game Perspective Shifting

## Overview
The game has shifted from 2D to 3D since Azhar joined the team, allowing more time to experiment with 3D settings. Most of the scripts from the original 2D game have been successfully transferred to the 3D version. Additionally, jumping has been added since it's now in 3D, though there's uncertainty about keeping it as it may change the play style.

## Planned Updates
- **Health and Experience Bars**: Planning to add health and experience bars to the game. The experience bar will display the player's level next to it. Upon leveling up, the health bar will be refilled to full.
- **Isometric Camera View**: Implemented an isometric camera view for a different perspective.
- **Player Knockback on Enemy Hit**: Intending to add player knockback when hit by an enemy, pushing the player in the opposite direction for better feedback.
- **Shooting Mechanics Consideration**: Debating whether to keep the current shooting style (based on the player's facing direction) or change it to shoot from the player's cursor position. This change would significantly impact the play style.

## Conclusion
These updates aim to leverage the transition to 3D, enhance player feedback, and refine gameplay mechanics. The addition of health and experience bars, along with player knockback and potential shooting mechanic changes, will contribute to a more immersive and engaging player experience.
