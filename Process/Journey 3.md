**Game Concept:**
- The game is a restaurant-based rogue-like top-down view game set in an apocalyptic scenario where the player, as the last surviving chef, must fend off hordes of mad "zombie" customers.

**Mechanics and Features:**
1. **Class-Based Gameplay:**
   - Players choose a chef class based on the type of cuisine they specialize in, each offering unique strengths and abilities.
   - Example classes: Burger Chef (strength-focused), Sushi Chef (agility-focused), Pizza Chef (versatile), etc.

2. **Specialized Weapons:**
   - Weapons are derived from kitchen utensils and ingredients, each with distinct effects and playstyles.
   - Examples: Spatula (for burger chefs), Sushi Knife (for sushi chefs), Pizza Cutter (for pizza chefs), etc.

3. **Unique Abilities:**
   - Each class possesses unique abilities tied to their culinary expertise, allowing for strategic combat and traversal.
   - Examples: Flaming Hot Sauce (sets enemies on fire), Barbecue Skewers (stabbing attacks), Durian (slows or repels enemies), Sticky Rice (immobilizes enemies), etc.

4. **Environmental Hazards:**
   - Utilize elements of the restaurant environment as both obstacles and tools in combat.
   - Examples: Gas stoves (to ignite enemies), slippery floors (to hinder enemy movement), crowded tables (for cover), etc.

5. **Character Progression:**
   - Players collect ingredients and recipes throughout the game to unlock new weapons, abilities, and upgrades.
   - Customize character builds to suit individual playstyles and preferences.

6. **Enemy Variety:**
   - Encounter diverse types of mad customers, each with unique behaviors and weaknesses.
   - Adapt strategies based on enemy strengths and patterns.

**Goals and Considerations:**
- **What is the Specialty and Uniqueness about this game?** The game's specialty lies in its restaurant-themed setting, class-based gameplay, and creative weapon and ability mechanics.
- **Balanced Gameplay:** Ensuring balance across classes and weapons is crucial to providing an enjoyable experience for players, encouraging experimentation with different playstyles.
- **Mid-Fidelity Implementation:** The current prototype is mid-fidelity, focusing on implementing new themes and mechanics while refining gameplay based on player feedback.

**Next Steps:**
- Incorporate additional weapon types and classes based on player feedback.
- Fine-tune gameplay mechanics and balance to ensure each class and weapon is viable and enjoyable to play.
- Expand environmental interactions and hazards to enhance strategic depth and immersion.
